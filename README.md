This project is written in Python to simplify the appointment scheduling process for hospitals and medical centers. The messages and commands of this bot are written in Persian.

The library used to connect this bot to Telegram is the Python Telegram Bot library, one of the best libraries for this purpose. Of course, several other libraries such as time and psycopg, which is used for database connection, are also used in this project. Additionally, this Telegram bot uses a PostgreSQL database to store and read information.

The features implemented in this bot include:
- Booking a doctor's appointment
- Canceling a doctor's appointment
- Viewing appointments
- Setting appointment reminders
- Canceling the process
- Learning how commands work

I also used buttons designed for Telegram bots in some parts of the project. It should be noted that this bot has not been used in hospitals and medical centers and may have some deficiencies.
